Storm RARE ⛈ Very hard to earn, and it is rare for a lion to receive it. In addition to being a grand hunter and fighter they must also have proven themselves worthy of the name by displaying traits akin to Cansu. This lion must be strong, determined, and have great stamina and agility. Those under the name Storm are excellent hunters, and it is a very high honor to receive this name. Those blessed by this namesake are greatly respected by other lions, even those outside of their Pride
