Sun RARE ☀️  Very hard to earn, and it is rare for a lioness to receive it. In addition to being a grand hunter and fighter they must also have proven themself to be worthy of the name by living their life and displaying traits akin to Sunce. The huntress must be clever, fierce, have seemingly endless energy, as well as being extremely fast and able to leap high into the sky. It is a very high honor if a huntress is able to receive this name and they are normally greatly respected by most other huntresses, even those outside of their pride.
