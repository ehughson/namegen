Storm RARE ⛈  Very hard to earn, and it is rare for a lioness to receive it. In addition to being a grand hunter and fighter they must also have proven themself to be worthy of the name by living their life and displaying traits akin to Cansu. The huntress must be strong, determined, and seem to be able to run forever, as well as being a great hunter. It is a very high honor if a huntress is able to receive this name and they are normally greatly respected by most other huntresses, even those outside of their pride.
